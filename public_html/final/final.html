                                As a college senior, Wendy Kopp proposed Teach For America's creation in her Princeton 
                                University undergraduate thesis. She was convinced that many in her generation were searching 
                                for a way to assume a significant responsibility that would make a real difference in the 
                                world and that top college students would choose teaching over more lucrative opportunities 
                                if a prominent teacher corps existed. As a 21 year-old, Kopp raised $2.5 million of start-up 
                                funding, hired a skeleton staff, and launched a grass-roots recruitment campaign. During 
                                Teach For America's first year in 1990, 500 men and women began teaching in six low-income 
                                communities across the country. Since then, some 17,000 individuals have joined, Teach For 
                                America has become the nation's largest provider of teachers for low-income communities, and 
                                we have been recognized for building a pipeline of leaders committed to educational equity 
                                and excellence.
