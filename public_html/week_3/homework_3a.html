            <h1>US residents like DSL better than cable</h1>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.ce.org/Press/CurrentNews/press_release_detail.asp?id=10986">
                study</a> titled &quot;Broadband and the Home of Tomorrow,&quot; the Consumer
                Electronics Association says that the war between cable and DSL
                providers is in full swing. According to the report, the US now
                ranks 15th in the world in terms of the percentage of households
                with broadband. Over 43 million US households have broadband access
                of some sort. Dial-up is now used in only 36 percent of US
            households, down from 60 percent in 2003.</p>

            <h2>The Race is close</h2>
            <p>DSL and cable are neck-and-neck.<br />
                Each delivery method
                accounts for 29 percent of the home Internet access market. In
                contrast, cable had 15 percent of the market in 2000, while DSL
            accounted for a measly 4 percent. </p>
            <h2>Customer Satisfaction</h2>
            <p>When it comes to customer satisfaction, DSL rules the roost. <br />
                61
                percent of consumers would recommend the service to a friend or
                family member, compared with only 46 percent for cable. Behind those
                figures loom the key service differentiators: speed and price. Cable
                subscribers are more likely to be happy with the speed of their
                service (76 percent) than DSL users (69 percent) and dial-up users
            (26 percent). <em>The bigger factor, however, appears to be price.</em> </p>
            <h2>DSL Providers are Aggressive!</h2>
            <p>DSL providers have been extremely aggressive with pricing. <br />

                In the last couple of years, DSL providers have been very aggressive
                with pricing over in an attempt to grab the lion's share of
                broadband customers. That continues today, with AT&amp;T offering
                residential DSL (up to 1.5Mbps) for as little as US$12.99 during the
                first year of service. Low prices resonate well with cost-conscious
                consumers, with only 26 percent of cable Internet users happy with
                the price they pay for service. Contrast that with the 46 percent of
                DSL users and 53 percent of dial-up users who are happy with the
            price.</p>
            <h2>DSL is Priced to Move</h2>
            <p>Why aren't more people abandoning pokey dial-up connections? <br />
                Strange as it may seem to those of us who spend
                a lot of time online, some people just don't want or see the need
                for broadband. Up to 18 percent of current Internet users have
                <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060227-6270.html">no
            plans to upgrade</a> to broadband at any price.</p>
            <p>Although consumers appear to be at least somewhat satisfied with
                the speed and price of broadband offerings, what they would really
            like is more choice. </p>
            <p class="quote">"Consumers desire even more choice when it comes to broadband.
                Currently, only 15 percent of online U.S adults are very satisfied
                with their current number of ISP choices. It boils down to choice
                and the value equation. Yes, speed and reliability are important,
                but the cost must be factored in, and when it comes to cable,
            consumers increasingly are missing the value."</p>
            <h2>My Take on the Issue</h2>

            <p class="bigLetter">Count me among the other 85 percent. I have little to complain
                about when it comes to the reliability and speed of my cable
                Internet connection (it has topped 11Mbps down at times and usually
                comes in around 8Mbps), but I pay dearly for it. DSL isn't feasible
                for me, despite my living in Chicago, due to the lousy
                infrastructure in my neighborhood and the distance I live from the
                nearest central office. I'd like to have other options in terms of
                speed, price, and other amenities such as a fixed IP address, but
            that just isn't in the cards at this time....</p>
